                            offered by the restaurant and scrollable vertical text fragments for the individual items.

                            item, a new activity opens that shows the item's full name, image, description and price

                            notations. The primitive types being things such as booleans, characters, integers,
                            floating-point numbers,
                            and by reference. The non-primitive types being things such as arrays and strings. And very
                            importantly, the <b><i>abstract data types</i></b> such as arrays, lists,
