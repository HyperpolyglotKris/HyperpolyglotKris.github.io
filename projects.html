                            Clicking on a new category changes the list of items. All categories and items are objects
                            created from a database and inflated into their respective containers. Upon clicking on an
                            item, a new activity opens that shows the item's full name, image, description and price
                            with an amount selector and a button to add to cart. The app contains a navigation bar

                            clicking the expand menu icon, and through it you can cycle between the Food Menu and the
                            Orders. The orders display all selected items, the amount selected, cumulative price and
                            total price.

                        <h4>Deployed Web Services - Java/SpringBoot (REST/SOAP/Microservices)</h4>
                        <p><i>-REST Web Service: </i>Web Service for bookkeeping information. The
                            GET/POST/PUT/DEL do their appropriate functions respectively and return the appropriate
                            server responses.
                            The GET returns the object of the book whose ID was requested. The
                            POST adds a new book object to the database (array of objects) of the server and assigns it
                            an ID. The PUT modifies the content of the book with the specified ID with the new
                            information. The DEL deletes the book with the specified ID.
                            <br><br>
                            <i>-SOAP Web Service: </i> Web Service with three different methods. First method is
                            for
                            computing and returning a fibonacci sequence up to a certain amount of numbers. Second
                            method allows the user to upload a file to the server by joining it as an attachment to the
                            body of the request. The third
                            method allows the user to download a file from the server if the specified file is found.
                            <br><br>
                            <i>-Microservices: </i> The first microservice allows the user to look up the price
                            of a
                            specific fruit on a specific month, which can be found in a database part of the server. The
                            second microservice
                            allows the user to request a total price for a given number of a given fruit on a given
                            month. Both microservices run independently on their own port, and the second microservice
                            calls upon the first one in order to do it's task before returning the result.

                            notations. Created Java classes from scratch for the following <b><i>abstract data
